### Hitting
You try to do too much at the plate sometimes, putting it directly on the right field line. That led to an 0-2 in game 2 and the overall low point of the season. Hit right center gap more, and be conscious of scenarios on the base paths a bit. You're error in the final game was not great when you got doubled up. 

### Fielding
Solid tracking, but better decisions on throws is necessary. You made 2 throwing errors where you tried to throw someone out at home, and it gave up an extra base to the runner going from second to third.
