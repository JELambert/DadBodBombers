### Hitting
Really like your approach at the plate, you stay patient and don't try to do too much. I see you as a key member of our next up group after the top 4-5 and a strong showing you could compete for those spots too. In all reality, how that group does dictates if we win and score more than 7, so no pressure. 

I tell everyone else to stay patient and let the ball travel, and that remains true for you too, however since you are lefty, you have a natural advantage when pulling the ball to right. Use it if the ball is on the inside half, or crowd the plate to give yourself a little added advantage there. 


### Fielding
Oof I know this is a sore topic so I'll give it to you straight. I need you to play outfield. You and Grace are pretty close to a wash at first base in my eyes, and I have a few guys who are a little worse but can't play anywhere else who might play first too. 

But... you are easily the third best outfielder and the only one at this stage I'm comfortable putting in either right center or left if Forrest and I are out. That flexibility is absolutely huge and unless you really really don't want to play out there, I'm going to keep asking it of you.

On the outfield specific suggestions I'd say the area you can improve the most is drop steps. These are the toughest thing to do generally in the outfield and so take a lot of practice. But try to get comfortable if the ball feels like its behind you, to take a really strong open hips drop step where you turn and sprint straight backwards. You run until you get behind the fly ball then turn back around if you have time. If not you catch it while running backwards.

You do really well on balls coming up, and getting ball to cutoff quick. So thats all I got.
