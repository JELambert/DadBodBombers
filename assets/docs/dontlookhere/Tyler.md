### Hitting
Gotta be honest, perhaps my narcissism was over exaggerated but I fully expected to be the best hitter on the team. You've put that in check. Absolutely crushed the ball.

No meaningful feedback, stay patient I guess and take pitches. Rather you crush that perfect strike than hit a single off a bad pitch. 

### Fielding
I see you as primarily an outfielder in left center or right. Focus on two things, 
1. Stopping the ball thats hard hit at or around you. Sometimes take a more conservative angle to get really far behind those hard hit balls so they don't get past you. That extra second or two doesn't hurt nearly as bad as misjudging it and letting it go to fence.
2. Rapid fire to cutoff. Most of the time it will be me or the second baseman. How hard you throw it is not important at all. Its all about how fast you go from fielding it to getting it out of your hand accurately. Better to short hop a throw, throw it in the ground in front, than overthrow too.
