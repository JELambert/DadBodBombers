### Hitting
I see you as huge power potential. When you hit it, you hit the hell out of the ball. I don't want to take that mentality away, but if you get a little more patient I think you could see a significant rise in BA and OBP. You've got all the tools technique wise, and I expect HRs will still come, but don't be afraid to take a little off and make good contact.

### Fielding
Fantastic work in the field. I see you as our infield glue so probably expect to play 2b, ss, and 3b at various points. No real suggestions here just keep pluggin away with what you are doing.
