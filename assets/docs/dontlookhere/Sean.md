### Hitting
Tremendous potential here. I think you could benefit from cage time more than anyone. You just need cuts, hundreds of cuts. You've got power, you've got contact, but putting all that together on two - three balls a game is hard. I'm happy to go with you, find sometime and lets get wiffle balls or go to dbat. You're floor is bottom of the lineup, but your ceiling is one of the best hitters on the team.

### Fielding
I see you as a primary second baseman, backup first baseman, and in ultimate needs a catcher. 

You do well stopping the ball at second and great job making throws. Second base is a lot of extras too including situational coverage of second, backing up throws in, and being a cutoff. We can work some on those, but it will take time. One thing that might help is working on taking steps to either left or right side and fielding grounders off hand. That will give you extended range at second and be important going forward.
