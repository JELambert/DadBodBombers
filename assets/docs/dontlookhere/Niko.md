### Hitting
Huge power man, showed that in your first appearance in game. Take your time at bat, don't swing at bad pitches, and don't be afraid to take a little off your swing to make good contact. You have power to spare, but that extra contact could be the difference in you batting 500 and you batting 700. 

### Fielding
Alrighy reckoning time with the sandwhich technique. Love your effort in the field. We have more consistent guys on the infield. I think you have value in a ton of places. 

See what I did there? Little sandwhich.

But in all seriousness, if you only want to play infield that is cool and we can make it work. If you are amenable I have a couple of suggestions. All of these are selfishly geared at two things, I get more flexibility in putting people in the field, and you are likely to make a lot more plays per possible play.
1. Think about pitching some
	1. Cody is pitching but I have yet to be convinced he is definitely the only pitcher we need. You could have a good spot helping out there.
2. Think about working in the outfield
	1. You are (I hate to say this), the fastest person on the team. That attribute alone could make you an asset out there.
3. If neither of those sounds appealing second base is your home.
	1. If second is your home, take your time, knock the ball down, and make nice easy throws. I know you can do it! We can work on situational stuff too.

Alright thats what I got, you can digest and get back to me with your thoughts and we will accommodate accordingly.
