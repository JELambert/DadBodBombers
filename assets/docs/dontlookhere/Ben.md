### Hitting
Had an absolutely stellar first season and a really solid second season. Think some of the difference was my fault to be honest, leadoff just isn't best spot for you. I like you in 4-6 slots a lot. 

Stay patient, swinging at good pitches and letting bad stuff go. Should be no fear for you to get behind in the count and still feel confident you can put a good swing on the bat. Like we work on in the cage think about hitting it where its pitched, letting it travel and driving it to center or right field at times. Overall really fantastic stuff though keep going.

### Fielding
I see you as our primary left center and perhaps at times able to play right or left too. 

You've been really great about catching whats at you and getting the ball in so no real suggestions to do anything different. I'd say if you want to expand your outfield capabilities the next step is to get really good at that drill we practiced in some of our first practices. Where you take a drop step left or right directly behind you and sprint to catch the ball on the run. That will help you get more comfortable expanding your range.
