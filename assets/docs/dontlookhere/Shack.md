### Hitting
I know you've indicated some consternation about lineup position before, but let me know if you have concerns. I think you are in the last group until you get the BA above 500 again.

Be a goldfish. You have some power, but I think you gotta forget about last at bat and just focus in on the moment. Don't worry about hitting it hard, worry about hitting it solid. You hit some really good ones in the cage. 

I'd say often your stance is to narrow to start and your step takes your head level down a foot which means your trying to track the ball thats moving both forward and back and up and down with added difficulty. Widen out, short step. 

### Fielding
I see you as a primary catcher, I'm not sure if you still want to play other positions but again chat with me if you do. I can see First base or Right field potentially but both come with a new set of challenges. First requires a lot more movement laterally, and right will be a lot of sprinting potentially. I'll focus on catcher for now.

For both you and Frank we gotta work potentially just us three, where I throw it in from outfield as hard as I can and you guys try to make the catch. Like we talked about step up in front the plate and make the tag after you catch it rather than trying to navigate a baserunner barreling toward you while a balls coming in at 80mph. Thats a lot of variables. Want to make it as simple as possible. We can practice more though just let me know when works.
