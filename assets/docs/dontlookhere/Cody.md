### Hitting
Hitting has been great, you are right on the cusp of a top 5 spot and have carried that since starting. I put Ben ahead of you by a hair given his first season but you are next up and could compete for slots 4/5 this season in all likelihood. 

Not much feedback on technique, I think you'll find more gaps the more you go to right center, but overall I'd keep doing what you're doing. Focus on contact and let the power come from patience.

### Fielding
This is going to be mostly pitching. I like you at pitcher a lot, I think its the best fit position you have. I see a potential for you at 1st maybe, but we have a lot of good infielders and its not clear you want to play outfield. But you fill a tremendous need and have great value at pitching. 

On the pitching side, this season try to focus on one thing and one thing only. 0 Walks. Don't worry about how many hits you give up, let you're defense work for you, and if they are constantly finding gaps or hitting it over we tip our caps. Find you're rhythm on the mound and hit the strike zone. Be a goldfish, forget any mistakes and keep plugging away. We have confidence in you and we are behind you!
