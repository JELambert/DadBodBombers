### Hitting
You had a fantastic opening season, and a tougher second season. I really think all of that comes down to one thing. **Patience**. A lot of those outs this season were bad pitches that were hard to hit and so you couldn't put a good bat on the ball. Stay patient and you'll start getting back in the groove. You've got speed on the base paths which is huge so a lot of good tools to use. You'll get back in the groove. 

### Fielding
I think you've been great in the outfield. I see you as primarily a left center and right fielder, with some backup left field time too. 

Couple of general suggestions:
1. Stopping the ball thats hard hit at or around you. Sometimes take a more conservative angle to get really far behind those hard hit balls so they don't get past you. That extra second or two doesn't hurt nearly as bad as misjudging it and letting it go to fence.
2. Rapid fire to cutoff. Most of the time it will be me or the second baseman. How hard you throw it is not important at all. Its all about how fast you go from fielding it to getting it out of your hand accurately. Better to short hop a throw, throw it in the ground in front, than overthrow too.
