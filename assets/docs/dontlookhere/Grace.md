### Hitting
Just fantastic work this season at the plate. You were patient, you took what they gave you and you made excellent contact. 

On technique side, I think the more you focus yourself on letting the ball travel into the zone and comfortably hitting balls to center and right center, you'll see an increase in power as well. It is somewhat counterintuitive, but taking a little off the swing and letting ball travel can do wonders for balls that actually fly. 
### Fielding
I think you are our primary first baseman, perhaps at times a safety net at both pitcher and outfield. But I'd focus mentally on first base.

Couple of things that might help:
1. Practice you're timing even when you are just warming up, both feet on the bag taking that step and timing the catch for the same moment. Try to treat every throw like its a throw coming at you at first.
2. Don't be afraid to relinquish the bag on terrible throws. Give up the out over giving up extra bases especially when you have extra runners on first.
3. Picking is hard same thing as above, treat warmumps as practice for picking the ball too.
4. Start thinking that you need to backup almost every single throw to home plate and moving accordingly.
