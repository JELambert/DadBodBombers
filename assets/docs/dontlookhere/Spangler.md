### Hitting
I think of most people, you have the biggest potential jump in improvement coming this season. I see you as a next group up after the top 5, but in reality, you could very well take one of those spots.

My suggestion is only 1 thing: Stay patient. Don't swing at bad pitches and just let it come to you. When you make good contact you crush it. The difference between batting 500 and 800 is just that patience and I think you have it coming.

### Fielding
0 notes. You've been fantastic at Short and basically changed our trajectory as a team. It's your position, you are captain of the infield feel free to take charge wherever you see fit.
