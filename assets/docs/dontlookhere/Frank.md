### Hitting
Little tougher second season but still some good things to take away. I think finding the right pitch is key, a lot of the outs you had were on balls that were just less hittable so stay patient. You'll find your rhythm. Don't be afraid to let the ball travel and hit to rightfield too. 

### Fielding
I see you as a primary Catcher and backup pitcher, potentially emergency first baseman too. I think catcher you've got good. 

One suggestion is on plays that are at the plate, take a step out in front of the plate to make the catch. This will take you out of the way of runners, makes the catch a little easier, and ultimately if you don't have time to turn and make the tag it wasn't a play we were going to make anyway. Other than that, maybe try to keep bad throws in front since they grab extra bases if it gets past. 

You could see an uptick in pitching again if Cody struggles. You will likely be emergency mid inning relief so prepare for that.
