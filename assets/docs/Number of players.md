After three seasons we have a solid base of information to make some evidence-based assessments. 

One thing to address now is the relationship between success and number of players in the lineup. 

In season 3, we saw the first instance of having large numbers consistently show up for games. And while we want to encourage increasing participation, at some point we need to make a cutoff on one team and allow overflow to lead to an additional team (see Bombers roadmap). 

So the question is how do we define that number? Thresholding is always problematic and often leads to issues in a variety of analytical scenarios. However, we must endeavor to set one, and set one correctly. 

This brings me to my original statement. *I hypothesize that the relationship between wins(Dependent variable) and number of player (independent variable) exhibits an inverse U shape*

Put another way for any of our more financially oriented readers, adding players to the lineup leads to diminishing returns. 

### Finding that sweet spot
I pulled our 22 games played thus far and assessed how we did on a number of metrics. 

A couple of caveats to this crude analysis. We can explain success in many ways and cherry picking which metric to use will obscure others. A variety of confounding factors undoubtedly led to success variation in some cases vs others. But we go to battle with the data we have. 

Low numbers are a non-starter. Not for the reason of success but for the reason of sustainability. We have now witnessed multiple injuries that ultimately led to players being limited or unable to complete games. For this reason the lowest we can reasonably have is not 11, but 12. An uncommon but normal occurence is one person going down. We should be prepared for the absolute worst case scenario, 2 people going down. That means 12 is our baseline.

So that makes this analysis a little easier, we just care about 12 players or above. 

In the field having more in the lineup means we get more people rotating. We have at this point not taken fielding stats into account so this is anecdotal only. Given these are short games, I'm inclined to suspect more rotating players isn't helping much in fatigue. It is likely leading to some stagnation in looseness however. So more in this case, likely not better.

At bat however we have some stats. 

Cumulative stats to think about are: runs, singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, and RBIs. 

Central tendency stats to consider are: batting average, on-base and slugging percentage. 

All cumulative stats (with the exception of HRs) have a negative correlation coefficient larger than 0.8. This indicates that as number of players increase we witness a strong negative effect on the resultant success metric.

All central tendency stats exhibit the similar direction, being negative, greater than 0.3. These are a bit more moderated than cumulative however taken in conjunction lend creedence to the underlying hypothesis. 

Going above 12 exhibits negative effects on success outcomes. 

For this reason structuring the team to only have 12 active lineup members on any given game is the optimal alignment.
