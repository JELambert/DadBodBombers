These justifications take into account both seasons, however a bit more weight is added to recency. Maybe 70/30 ish. This can change, and I'll try to keep it updated as the season goes on. I like to give folks some confidence by letting them hit in a position for a game or two before making big switches. This can change and is just representative of he 20-30 at bats most people have gotten. 
### Leadoff 
**NEW LEADOFF ALERT** -- Sweet
* I kept going back and forth between Sweet and Forrest, both have been on fire this season. Ended up with Sweet but its neck and neck between our two 1000 ba, 1000 obp players. 
### 2 and 3
Forrest and Spangler
* Just fantastic start of the season for both of these guys. Top fives all around, and it gives me absolute joy to have a 1-3 of lefties...
### 4 and 5
Ben, and Grace. 
* Can function as leadoffs, always on base, HR power, effort on basepaths to keep innings alive. 
* Next Up: Josh and Beep

A note past 5. We now get into situational orders dependent upon who remains relative to each other. Groupings do not relate to exact order but where in the extended order they are likely to bat.
