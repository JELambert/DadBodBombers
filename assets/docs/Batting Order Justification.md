These justifications take into account both seasons, however a bit more weight is added to recency. Maybe 70/30 ish. This can change, and I'll try to keep it updated as the season goes on. I like to give folks some confidence by letting them hit in a position for a game or two before making big switches. This can change and is just representative of he 20-30 at bats most people have gotten. 
### Leadoff 
Based on what we need out of a leadoff its Beep.
* Most singles last season, situational awareness demonstrated in the game we needed extended, BA in top 3. Not bottom speed when he wants. He gives us a chance to score immediately. 
* Next up: Grace, Cody, Spangler
### 2 and 3
Tyler and Josh. 
* Tops in almost every category. Highest two in. slugging % by a ways. Hits per at bat, xb hits per at bat. I give Tyler the edge in the two hole because he has more Hits/At bat. 
* Next up: Grace, Cody, Spangler

### 4 and 5
Grace and Ben. 
* Can function as leadoffs, always on base, HR power, effort on basepaths to keep innings alive. This one was close, Cody had a slightly better season 2 than Ben, but Ben had such a dominate season 1. Slight edge Ben.
* Next Up: Cody, Spangler

----

A note past 5. We now get into situational orders dependent upon who remains relative to each other. Groupings do not relate to exact order but where in the extended order they are likely to bat.

----
### 6 and 7
Cody, Spangler, Chris, Forrest
* I like having lefties mixed in here to keep teams moving so will sometimes stagger them. These are next four up in BA so satisfies contact need, with some power as well from Forrest and Cody. 
* Next Up: Dan, Niko
### 8 and 9 
Dan, Niko
* Home run power so its a good time to plug in that high risk/reward before end of lineup. Below 500 batting average. 
* Next Up: Renzo
### 10, 11, 12
Renzo, Frank, Sean, Shack
* Below 300 BA last season, could put Renzo at the end to add a functional *second* leadoff given his speed.
