[[Fielding Justification]]

SKIPABOVE


Overall philosophy is this: Put people in positions to succeed! Not everyone is a good player at each position. Some positions have a lot tougher job than others. Want to highlight players strengths and mitigate weaknesses. 

## Infield
Infield can be fickle in that some games you get very few balls and some games you get a ton. We need to always make easy popup catches to give ourselves the best chance. 
### Pitcher
One of the most important positions on the field. Can be extremely mentally taxing. You must be a goldfish. The single most important need is: Strikes. Rather give up hits than walks and hits. 

### Catcher
This is one of the most engaging positions in the field. You are constantly involved, and while it does not require much lateral movement, there are times where high importance plays at the plate are critical and require focus and hand eye coordination. Need someone who can maintain focus.

### 1st base
Important position because if we can't make plays at first going to be tough to get out of innings. Needs to be conscious of backing up plays at home. Scooping balls and hustling down overthrows also key. 

### 2nd base
Typically the position that gets more approachable grounders and low intensity throws to first. Good lateral range is useful, and high IQ. Needs to be really conscious:
1. plays at second with runners on first
2. Cutoffs from right field
3. Throws to second from left
4. maintaining position at 2nd during run down situations

### SS 
Most important position in the infield, and perhaps on the field. The most difficult. Needs all the high IQ mentioned above for situational awareness as well as strong arm, quick reactions, and a short memory. 

### 3rd base
Second toughest after short. Needs basically all of the same attributes except some lessened lateral agility acceptable. Needs to be very conscious of throws home and backing up there.

## Outfield

As a philosophy on the outfield, positioning may be dependent upon who we have and what combination of outfielders we have. We play an over exaggerated shift with certain personnel and then straight up positioning with others. In general, its good to stagger players with high range to Left Field and Right Center. Allowing for players with less range to play in positions that get more direct hits.
### Left Field
Preferably a mobile and high range player with an ok arm since most throws will go directly to short stop cut off. The balls hit to left may be line drives which are hard to play so an outfielder with some experience is preferable. 

### Left Center
Balls hit to left center are often bombs to the fence. Therefore asking a player to play this with deep positioning puts them in the best location for success. They have both left field and right center to help with shallow balls and cutoffs for very deep throws.

### Right Center
In the exaggerated shift position this is the position that is expected to do the most. By playing a center or shallow center position they are expected to cover the most ground, and at times be the cutoff for both Right and Left Center. High Baseball IQ, speed, and arm strength are pivotal for success.

### Right
While the classical, stick your worst outfielder here position, in softball good teams actually pick on this position a lot. So to mitigate this we play Right fielders a lot like left fielders, deep positioning with the expectation of catching direct popups and quickly stopping the grounders hit and getting it to cutoff (most typically Right Center fielder). Teams that are good will punish this position so it needs to be prepared.
