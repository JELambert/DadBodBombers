## 1. Forced Runs

In situations where the base behind the runner is occupied, the runner is said to be "forced" to run to the next base.

**Key Points:**
- Always be alert of the ball's location. If the ball is hit, you **have to run.**
- Pay attention to the number of outs. With two outs, **run on any hit.**

## 2. Tagging Up

Tagging up is when a runner on base waits on the bag until a flyball is caught, then attempts to advance to the next base.

**Key Points:**
- On a deep flyball, return to your base and be ready to sprint as soon as the outfielder catches the ball.
- Use the outfielder's momentum against them. If they're moving away from your intended base, it's usually a good time to tag up.
- Always watch your coach for signals. They have the best view of the play.

## 3. Running on Flyballs

When a flyball is hit to the outfield, it's crucial to determine whether to tag up or get a lead.

**Key Points:**
- **Short Flyballs**: For balls you think will be caught easily, stay near the bag to tag up.
- **Deep Flyballs**: If the ball is going deep and you believe there's a chance it might not be caught, take a lead but be ready to return.
- **Getting Off the Bag**: Aim to get a lead of about a third of the way to the next base for deep flyballs, but always be ready to either advance or retreat based on the outfielder's action.

## 4. Making the Turn

When approaching a base with the potential of advancing further, it's important to make a good turn.

**Key Points:**
- Approach the bag from the right side, allowing you to touch the corner of the base and push off with your right foot, propelling you towards the next base.
- Always look to your coach while rounding bases. They'll indicate whether to stop or continue.
- Only commit to going to the next base if you're certain or if your coach signals you to. It's better to be safe than sorry.

## 5. Other Key Baserunning Principles

- **Anticipate the Play**: Always have an idea of where you'll go if the ball is hit. This involves reading the defense and the situation.
  
- **Run Through First Base**: When running to first base, always run through the bag rather than slowing down. This gives you the best chance to beat out any throws.
  
- **Slide When Necessary**: Even in adult softball, there can be close plays. If you believe there's a chance of being tagged out, slide to avoid the tag. This is not only strategic but can prevent collisions and injuries.
  
- **Communication**: Always listen to your base coaches. They have a broader view of the field and can guide your decisions on whether to advance or hold.
  
- **Practice**: Like all aspects of the game, baserunning improves with practice. Regularly run the bases during practice sessions, simulating different game situations.
