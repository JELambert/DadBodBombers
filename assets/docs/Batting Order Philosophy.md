My most recent justification of orders is here [[Batting Order Justification]]

SKIPABOVE


First 5 batters generally get one extra at bat, so as a result, these spots will always be top 5 batters at a given time. 

### Leadoff 
While originally believed to be a speedy runner, watching TecoWestinghouse, and also how our next few hitters hit, we can see this position does not necessarily need to be our fastest person. They will almost certainly be hit in by spots 2-3. What we need from this position is someone who is:
1. Always on base (high batting %, high on base %). Out's are absolutely devastating from a leadoff.
2. Smart enough to take pitches, elongate game, and be situational since at end of games we may need this from someone who gets an extra at bat. 
3. Needs to be able to handle a little added pressure.

### 2 and 3
I put these together because they are in many ways the same justifications with only slight modifications. These must be your two best hitters. What is *Best* can be hard to determine, but in practice, they:
1. get on most often (BA), 
2. they get the most big hits (Doubles/Triples/HRs),
3. they are situational (understand late game situations), 
4. they understand how to move runners across (RBIs),
5. and they score (Runs). 

Many schools of thought vary but I typically follow the 2 hole is your best hitter, and 3 hole is runner up. These two need to generate between 4-5 runs per game between scoring and RBIs. 

### 4 and 5
Again these are put together because they are interchangeable in many ways. 

While it would be great to have Power Hitters in the classical sense of 4 and 5, in softball it's a little different. We need runs, and for us to sustain innings we need runners. 4 and 5 hole get an extra at bat typically so we need our next most reliable hitters. 

These batters often need to function as leadoffs/2/3 holes too. The chances are decent that 2 or 3 has already cleared the bases. So if 4 comes up with no one on, a HR does little to help us, but an out kills us. We need hitters who are getting on base as priority 1, and then getting extra base hits as priority 2. 

----

A note past 5. We now get into situational orders dependent upon who remains relative to each other. As a general philosophy you want to extend innings placing high contact earlier, followed by power and then end it with your lowest BA/OBP guys. Since we have typically 11-12 guys a game, I'm going to make a lineup to 12, but the groupings would get extended to 15. So 6 and 7 might become 6-9. 8-9 might become 10-13, etc. 

----
### 6 and 7
We need to keep innings going, piling on runs after a hopefully strong start from our top 5. Spray hitters with high BA and OBP are key. Depends on composition of who is present, but almost always a more reliable hitter who can sustain innings.

### 8 and 9 
At this point we are ready to start filtering in high risk, high reward folks. Might have lower BA but they also have a chance of jumping on a pitch and going deep, or really pushing the basepaths. 

### 10, 11, 12
To round out, we add in those who are not getting on base frequently. As an order of priority, higher BA, more hits, will likely bat before those with the opposite.
